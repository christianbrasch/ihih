# Website Security
While the na.pvrz.ml subdomain is hooked up to a freenom domain, the domain is connected to [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)'s nameservers, and the website itself is hosted through Cloudflare's Pages feature, which is also attached to this GitHub repository. 

## Data Collection
The nvralone website does not contain any sort of trackers (however, this could be different on resource pages [Read their privacy policies!]), and does not contain advertisements. 
We do not collect personal data.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in the website and it's coding or hosting, please contact [pvrz](https://github.com/pvrz) or email na@pvrz.ml
